These are the features of EventLink Event Manager.

# Event Website Builder

The event website builder is used to build, customise, and publish a complete event website. The builder uses "Blocks" which are sections on a website. A simple website might have the following order of blocks: Navbar, Hero, Footer. The purpose of the website builder is to allow organisers to create professional event websites without requiring complex technical knowledge. Our event website builder provides specialised blocks designed and curated specially for events and exhibitions.

## Adding Blocks

Organisers can choose any block from a list of blocks. By clicking on it or dragging the block into the site preview, they can add blocks to the website.

## Editing Blocks

Organisers can edit any block by clicking on a edit button that appears on the top left corner of the blocks in the editor. Clicking on the edit button, will open a edit panel. Each block will have its own editable properties. The edits are shown live in the editor preview. Once the organisers are satisfied with the edits, they can click save and the changes will be applied. If they're disatisfied, they can discard the changes.

## Deleting Blocks

Organisers can delete any block by clicking on a delete button that appears on the top left corner of the blocks in the editor. Clicking on the delete button will delete the block immediately.

## Responsive Design

Organisers can click on a button to toggle and view their site in either desktop or mobile mode. The site will change accordingly.

## Undo / Redo

If the organiser wants to, they can revert or redo their changes at anytime with a click of a button (or using ctrl + z / ctrl + shift + z on windows, command + z / command + shif t + z on mac).

## Saving

As the organiser is creating their website, the changes they have made will be saved.

## Publishing

With one click on a button, organisers can publish their website and make it online. The default domain of the website will be at the url: linkmyexpo.com/site/{websiteSlug}. Organisers can also choose to link their own domains.

## Sharing

Once the website is online, organisers can share their website easily by copying the provided url or their domain if they have it linked. We will also generate a downloadable QR code for them to use in marketing materials.
