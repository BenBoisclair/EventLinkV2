# PROJECT_GUIDE

## Collaboration Rules

1. When presented with a problem or request, always return a step-by-step plan first.
2. Ask for user confirmation before proceeding with any plan or action.
3. Think through problems step by step, ensuring clarity and thoroughness.
4. When working with a library or package, use available context to search for and reference its documentation before implementation.
