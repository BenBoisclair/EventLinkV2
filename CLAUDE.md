### Code Patterns & Conventions

#### Actions Pattern
Business logic is separated into action classes:
```php
// app/Actions/Attendee/RegisterAttendee.php
class RegisterAttendee
{
    public function execute(Event $event, array $data): Attendee
    {
        // Validation and business logic
    }
}
```

#### Vue Composables
Reusable logic extracted into composables:
```typescript
// resources/js/Composables/useBlockEditor.ts
export function useBlockEditor() {
    // Shared block editing logic
}
```

#### Type Safety
TypeScript interfaces for all data structures:
```typescript
// resources/js/types/event.ts
export interface Event {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    // ...
}
```

#### Real-Time Updates
WebSocket events for collaborative features:
```javascript
// Listen for block updates
Echo.private(`website.${websiteId}`)
    .listen('BlockUpdated', (e) => {
        // Update local state
    });
```

4. Build Vue components
5. Add to appropriate pages
6. Write tests

### Debugging
